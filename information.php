            <p>Our Anime Wardrobe Nepal brings you the best, comfortable and qualitative tshirts of beloved Anime/Marvel characters for the most affordable price.</p>
            <h3>Welcome To Our Wardrobe</h3>
            <p>Anime Wardrobr Nepal is an independent clothing label that we started way back in 2019. And by ‘independent’, we really mean it - we are not a big corporation and we don’t have any VC funding. We are a small business started by a bunch of friends and we’ve funded this whole thing from the ground up with our savings.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to curate some fantastic artwork by artists from all over the globe and to make the best damn t-shirts that we possibly can. We value the hard-earned money that you spend on us and we do our absolute best to get you some merchandise that you can be proud of.</p>
            <p>Every time you buy one of our products, you support great art and the artists behind them. We also collaborate with bands and festivals (support the scene, man), TV shows and great causes from time to time.</p>
            <p>So if you’re looking for some outstanding t-shirts, you’ve come to the right place!</p>
            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>The Internet can be a big, scary place filled with faceless companies and Nigerian royalty who just need your help in getting some funds out of the country. We are a small team of real-life humans (with big ideas!) and we will go out of our way to help you pick out your new favourite t-shirt.</p>
            <p>Need to talk to us? Mail us on: <a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank"> wardrobeanime@gmail.com</a> or call on +977 9861647817 or message us on <a href=""  target="_blank"> Facebook</a></p>
